PROCEDURE FOR TIMING CORRECTION

Time correction consists in two steps.

1) finding best estimation for t1, i.e. the timestamp of detector in front of the crystal (see article for accurate definition) by correcting the other timestamps for the expected delay

2) correcting t1 by the difference in delay wrt an external reference

Both corrections are based on calibration data. So first we need to extract the calibration plots that will be used.

1) BEST ESTIMATION OF T1

For each non-trigger detector, a plot of
